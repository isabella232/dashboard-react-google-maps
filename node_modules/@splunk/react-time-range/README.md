## Base Components vs Splunkweb Components

-   The Base Components have been completely isolated from Splunkweb, so they may be ported to other
    systems. However, it doesn't have capabilities that require Splunkweb:
    -   No support for epoch times. Only ISO is supported.
    -   Relative time strings cannot be previewed.
    -   Presets must be provided.
-   Splunkd components require several \$C variables to be defined:
    -   locale
    -   splunkdPath
